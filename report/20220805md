# relationship between EMG and reward experiment

**Hypothesis**
- EMG and Reward has a relationship <= adam did but didn't work?
- EMG and Direction has a relationship
- EMG and neural activity has a correlation
- Muscle fatigue has a relation ship with neural activity or reward

## Today's hypothesis: check the relationship between EMG and Reward

How to measure it?
- different condition
    - EMG change at different reward
    - EMG change at different direction
    - EMG change at different reward and direction

what data I use?
- mean RMS-EMG of each trail at different reward and direction

## Report

### 1. get RMS-EMG of each trail
**data struct**
- EMG
    - EMG channel label
    - data 5 channel
    - fs
- Behavior
    - each trails direction
    - each trails reward
    - each trails hand movement
    - each trails result
- neural activity
    - channel label
    - interior data
    - posterior data

## Bonus relationship between handmovement and EMG signal
