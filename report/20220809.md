# visualize EMG signal around Go Cue

## each signal and mean trajectory at each direction and muscle

Information:
- use only successed data
- MEG signal around Go Cue (-200 ms ~ +800 ms)
- gray lines are each trials and brack line is a mean trajectory
- position of figure means direction

## discussing and picking up good and bad sample

- Tric is bad many noise
- Trap is great. 0~135 degrees increase from 200ms to 300ms. 225~270 degree decrease little from 200ms to 300ms.
- PDel is better. 0~135 degrees increase from 200ms to 300ms. 225~270 degree decrease little from 200ms to 300ms.
- LBic is not so bad. 135~180 degrees increase. a 270 degree decreases.
- ADel is great. 45~180 degrees increase. 225~315 degree decrease.
